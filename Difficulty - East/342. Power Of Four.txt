Solution in Python :

class Solution:

    def isPowerOfFour(self , number : int) -> bool:

        # (number > 0) is the condition to check whether the given number is postive or not and it should be a positive number

        # ((number & (number - 1)) == 0) is the condition to evaluate whether it's a power of 2 or not

        # ((number & 0x55555555) != 0) is the condition to evaluate whether it's a power of 4 or not

        # 0x55555555 in binary it is represented as 01010101010101010101010101010101

        # where the 1's bits are only in the place which are the powers of 4

        return ((number > 0) and ((number & (number - 1)) == 0) and ((number & 0x55555555) != 0))
